In this chapter, we will learn about a commonly used sensor called a Hygrothermograph DHT11.

Project Hygrothermograph
****************************************************************

Hygrothermograph is an important tool in our lives to give us data on the temperature and humidity in our environment. In this project, we will use the RPi to read Temperature and Humidity data of the DHT11 Module.

Component knowledge
================================================================

The Temperature & Humidity Sensor DHT11 is a compound temperature & humidity sensor, and the output digital signal has been calibrated by its manufacturer.

After being powered up, it will initialize in 1 second. Its operating voltage is within the range of 3.3V-5.5V.
The SDA pin is a data pin, which is used to communicate with other devices. 

The NC pin (Not Connected Pin) are a type of pin found on various integrated circuit packages. Those pins have no functional purpose to the outside circuit (but may have an unknown functionality during manufacture and test). Those pins should not be connected to any of the circuit connections.
