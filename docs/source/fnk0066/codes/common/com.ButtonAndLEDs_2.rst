Project 2.2 MINI Table Lamp
****************************************************************

We will also use a Push Button Switch, LED and RPi to make a MINI Table Lamp but this will function differently: Press the button, the LED will turn ON, and pressing the button again, the LED turns OFF. The ON switch action is no longer momentary (like a door bell) but remains ON without needing to continually press on the Button Switch.

First, let us learn something about the push button switch.

Debounce a Push Button Switch
================================================================

When a Momentary Push Button Switch is pressed, it will not change from one state to another state immediately. Due to tiny mechanical vibrations, there will be a short period of continuous buffeting before it stabilizes in a new state too fast for Humans to detect but not for computer microcontrollers. The same is true when the push button switch is released. This unwanted phenomenon is known as “bounce”.

Therefore, if we can directly detect the state of the Push Button Switch, there are multiple pressing and releasing actions in one pressing cycle. This buffeting will mislead the high-speed operation of the microcontroller to cause many false decisions. Therefore, we need to eliminate the impact of buffeting. Our solution: to judge the state of the button multiple times. Only when the button state is stable (consistent) over a period of time, can it indicate that the button is actually in the ON state (being pressed).

This project needs the same components and circuits as we used in the previous section.
